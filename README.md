### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ i'm Arthur Gavazza
<p>I'm a software engineer passionate about understand how things work on every abstraction layer,I
  love challenges and problem solving. 
</p>
<p>I belive that undertanding the fundamentals of the technologies I'm using is critical for improving my problem solving skills, 
thats why I'm aways seeking to become a fullcycle developer.
</p>
<p>Most of my background is in freelancing and entrepenouship, I have a lot of experience
tranforming business requirements in real production ready products and that developed my Ubiquitous Language skills, 
 I also have learned a lot about devops and creating productive pipelies so that I was able to handle several differente projects 
 concurrently 
</p>
<p>I'm fascinated about low level stuff and my biggest passion in the moment is learning about distributed systems</p>
<p> I'm currently working on several projects using microservices with Golang Gin framework and Nestjs and as aways AWS </p>
